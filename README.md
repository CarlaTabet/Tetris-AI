This project implements an AI agent to play the classic game of Tetris using Deep Q-Learning. The AI leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to evaluate the game state and make strategic decisions. The learning component is designed to maximize the score by optimizing piece placement and minimizing gaps in the board.

# Use our code as follows:

Train the AI using the Deep Q-Learning algorithm by running:
## python train.py

Once the model is trained, you can watch the AI in action by running:
## python play.py
